Always update the repository documentation (README, docs/, CHANGELOG, or relevant files) after completing a task.

Be explicit about what changed and why, and include any commands required to build or test the changes.

Tests-first requirement:
Always write automated tests and run them before implementing a change. Include the test commands and test results (success/failure) in your change notes.

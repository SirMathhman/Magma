# Copilot / Assistant Instructions

Please follow these guidelines when making changes in this repository.

- After completing any task that changes or adds functionality, always create or update documentation describing the change (for example: README, CHANGELOG, docs/ files, or inline code comments). Documentation should explain the what, why, and how to use the new or changed behavior.

- Keep changes minimal and focused. Run tests and linters locally before opening a pull request.

- When adding new public APIs or commands, include usage examples and any required configuration.

- If a change affects behavior or migrations, add upgrade notes and backwards-compatibility considerations.

- Do not add new tests unless explicitly instructed to do so. This project aims for 100% test coverage, which requires tests to cover all branches; only add tests when requested so contributors avoid introducing excessive or narrowly-scoped tests and instead focus on generalizable, well-covered implementations.

Thank you for helping keep the project well-documented.

Test-Driven Design Guidelines:
1. Write tests before writing implementation code.
2. Start with a failing test that describes the desired behavior or feature.
3. Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
4. Refactor the code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability, ensuring all tests still pass.
5. Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bug fix.
6. Keep tests clear, isolated, and easy to understand.
7. Run all tests frequently to catch regressions early.

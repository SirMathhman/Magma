- At the end of every task, always run `npm run test` to ensure all tests pass and the codebase remains stable.
- If there are any linting errors after running `npm run test`, immediately fix these linting errors. Code is not considered "good" until it both functions correctly and adheres to all linting and style guidelines.
- Whenever new functionality is added, always add a corresponding test to cover it.

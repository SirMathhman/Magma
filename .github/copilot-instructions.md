Test-Driven Design Guidelines:
1. Write tests before writing implementation code.
2. Start with a failing test that describes the desired behavior or feature.
3. Run the failing test to confirm it fails before writing the implementation.
4. Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
5. Refactor the code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability, ensuring all tests still pass.
6. Update documentation as needed to reflect changes and new features.
7. Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bug fix.
8. You MUST run `npm run test` at the end.

Please prepare a formal project specification that accomplishes the following:

1. Precisely update the project requirements: restate the requested feature using formal project-spec language, including scope, constraints, acceptance criteria, and measurable success metrics.

2. Produce an architecture plan for the feature: describe the high-level design, component responsibilities, data flows, external interfaces, dependencies, deployment considerations, and any required schema or API changes; include assumptions and risk notes.

3. Provide a concrete example implementation or reference prototype: supply minimal, runnable code snippets or configuration, a usage example, and steps sufficient to demonstrate the feature end-to-end.

4. Conclude by prompting the user for further guidance: ask the user to propose at least three additional feature requests, and to indicate a priority (high/medium/low) and a one-line rationale for each.

Follow this process:

- Write the test
- Implement the test
- Remove duplicate code
- A single concept should be handled in a single place. We don't want the same concept to be handled by two different
  branches of code.
- Don't be afraid to separate a class into smaller ones.

Notes:

You are required to:

- Build using `build.bat`
- Build using `test.bat`

# Magma Compiler Project

This repository hosts the initial scaffolding for **Magma**, a self-hosted compiler for a hybrid language inspired by Rust and TypeScript. Development follows Kent Beck's rules of simple design and test-driven development.


## Philosophy

We aim for clarity and minimalism. The initial implementation is written in Python to bootstrap the toolchain quickly. As the compiler matures, it will become self-hosted in the Magma language.

Documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and is updated alongside the code.

See `docs/c_features_safety.md` for a checklist of C features and how we plan to handle them safely.

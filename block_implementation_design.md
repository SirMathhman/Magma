# Code Blocks Implementation Design

## 1. Parsing Blocks
- Blocks will be delimited by `{` and `}` characters
- Need to add support for recognizing these characters in the parser
- Similar to parentheses handling, need to check for mismatched braces
- Need to handle nested blocks

## 2. Variable Scoping
- Variables should be scoped to the block they're defined in
- Need to modify the `variables` map to track scope information
- When entering a block, create a new scope
- When exiting a block, remove variables defined in that scope
- Variables from outer scopes should be accessible in inner scopes
- Variables defined in inner scopes should not be accessible in outer scopes

## 3. C Code Generation
- Blocks in Magma will translate directly to blocks in C
- Need to preserve the curly braces in the output C code
- Each statement within a block should end with a semicolon
- The block itself doesn't need a semicolon

## 4. Implementation Approach
- Modify the `Compiler` class to handle blocks
- Add scope tracking to variable management
- Update the processing logic to handle nested blocks
- Add validation for proper block syntax

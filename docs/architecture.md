# Architecture changes: typed integer literal handling

Goal
----
Allow arithmetic between a typed integer literal (e.g. `1U8`) and an untyped integer literal (e.g. `2`). When one operand has a typed suffix and the other doesn't, the untyped operand should be treated as the same type for the purpose of range checking and arithmetic. For example: `Interpreter.interpret("1U8 + 2")` => `"3"`.

Files/Modules affected
----------------------
- `src/main/java/magma/Interpreter.java` — change addition evaluation logic to allow mixed typed/untyped operands when compatible.
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterFeatureTest.java` — add new failing test expressing the desired behavior.

Inputs/Outputs/Errors (contract)
--------------------------------
- Input: source strings representing simple integer arithmetic, e.g. `"1U8 + 2"`.
- Output: `Result.Ok` with the decimal sum as a string when evaluation succeeds (e.g. `"3"`).
- Errors: return `Result.Err` when parsing fails, types are mismatched, or values don't fit the typed width.

Migration / Compatibility notes
------------------------------
Existing behavior required both operands to have matching typed suffixes when either had a suffix. This change relaxes that to allow an untyped literal to participate if it fits into the typed width of the other operand. Mixed typed kinds (e.g., `U` vs `I`) remain invalid.

Tests to add
------------
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterFeatureTest.java` — new test `interpretTypedAndUntypedAddition_returnsSum` asserting `TestUtils.assertValid("1U8 + 2", "3")`.

Quality gates
-------------
- New test must fail initially (red).
- After implementation, `mvn -DskipTests=false test` must pass all tests.
- `mvn package` must build without errors; address checkstyle issues as needed.

Notes
-----
If the untyped literal is too large for the typed width (e.g., `1U8 + 300`), behavior should remain `Err` due to overflow constraints.
# Interpreter: typed integer literals + simple addition

Goal
----
Provide small, well-tested extensions to the existing `Interpreter.interpret(String, String)` behavior:

- Recognize typed integer literals with suffixes such as `I8`, `U32`, `I64` and validate ranges (existing behavior).
- Add support for a simple addition expression form: `<int> + <int>` (whitespace tolerant). For example `interpret("1 + 2", "")` should return `Result.Ok("3")`.

Files / Modules affected
------------------------
- `src/main/java/magma/Interpreter.java` — extended to evaluate simple addition expressions and keep typed-literal validation.
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterFeatureTest.java` — added feature test for addition.
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterTypedLiteralTest.java` — existing tests for typed literals (kept).

Contract (inputs / outputs / errors)
-----------------------------------
- Input: `source` string (program) and `input` string (runtime input).
- Success: `Result.Ok<String,String>` with the program output (literal text or computed decimal sum).
- Failure: `Result.Err<String,String>` when parsing fails, suffix invalid, or numeric validation fails.

Design notes
------------
- Changes are intentionally minimal and conservative: the public API `interpret(String,String)` is unchanged.
- Addition evaluation is a tiny ad-hoc evaluator for two-integer addition only. It uses `BigInteger` for safety and avoids regex use per repository policy.
- Typed suffix handling was extracted into a helper to reduce cyclomatic complexity and satisfy Checkstyle rules.

Tests added
-----------
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterFeatureTest.java`
  - `interpretSimpleAddition_returnsSum` asserts that `interpret("1 + 2", "")` returns `Ok("3")`.
  - `additionWithMismatchedTypedOperands_isErr` asserts that `interpret("1U8 + 2I32", "")` returns `Err` per the updated acceptance criteria (mixed typed integer arithmetic is invalid).
- Existing `InterpreterTypedLiteralTest.java` continues to validate typed literal parsing and range checks.

Quality gates
-------------
- New tests were added and executed; they initially failed as expected.
- After implementation and small refactors, the build and tests were run:
  - `mvn -DskipTests=false test` ran and all tests passed (10 tests total).
  - Checkstyle violations were addressed; `mvn package` completed successfully in this workspace.

Migration / Compatibility
-------------------------
- Behavior is additive. Programs that previously returned `Result.Err` remain Err unless they match the new literal or addition patterns.

Documentation changes
---------------------
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` to include the addition feature and list changed files.

Next steps / Enhancements
------------------------
- If more expression forms are desired (subtraction, multiplication, parentheses), consider adding a small expression parser with unit tests.
- Consider adding negative tests for malformed addition expressions (e.g., "1 + x") to make behavior explicit.

Documentation: updated `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the change and tests added.

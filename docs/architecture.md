# Interpreter: typed integer literals + simple addition

Goal
----
Provide small, well-tested extensions to the existing `Interpreter.interpret(String, String)` behavior:

- Recognize typed integer literals with suffixes such as `I8`, `U32`, `I64` and validate ranges (existing behavior).
- Add support for a simple addition expression form: `<int> + <int>` (whitespace tolerant). For example `interpret("1 + 2", "")` should return `Result.Ok("3")`.

Files / Modules affected
------------------------
- `src/main/java/magma/Interpreter.java` — extended to evaluate simple addition expressions and keep typed-literal validation.
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterFeatureTest.java` — added feature test for addition.
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterTypedLiteralTest.java` — existing tests for typed literals (kept).

Contract (inputs / outputs / errors)
-----------------------------------
- Input: `source` string (program) and `input` string (runtime input).
- Success: `Result.Ok<String,String>` with the program output (literal text or computed decimal sum).
- Failure: `Result.Err<String,String>` when parsing fails, suffix invalid, or numeric validation fails.

Design notes
------------
- Changes are intentionally minimal and conservative: the public API `interpret(String,String)` is unchanged.
- Addition evaluation is a tiny ad-hoc evaluator for two-integer addition only. It uses `BigInteger` for safety and avoids regex use per repository policy.
- Typed suffix handling was extracted into a helper to reduce cyclomatic complexity and satisfy Checkstyle rules.

Tests added
-----------
- `src/test/java/magma/InterpreterFeatureTest.java`
  - `interpretSimpleAddition_returnsSum` asserts that `interpret("1 + 2", "")` returns `Ok("3")`.
- Existing `InterpreterTypedLiteralTest.java` continues to validate typed literal parsing and range checks.

Quality gates
-------------
- New tests were added and executed; they initially failed as expected.
- After implementation and small refactors, the build and tests were run:
  - `mvn -DskipTests=false test` ran and all tests passed (10 tests total).
  - Checkstyle violations were addressed; `mvn package` completed successfully in this workspace.

Migration / Compatibility
-------------------------
- Behavior is additive. Programs that previously returned `Result.Err` remain Err unless they match the new literal or addition patterns.

Documentation changes
---------------------
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` to include the addition feature and list changed files.

Next steps / Enhancements
------------------------
- If more expression forms are desired (subtraction, multiplication, parentheses), consider adding a small expression parser with unit tests.
- Consider adding negative tests for malformed addition expressions (e.g., "1 + x") to make behavior explicit.

Documentation: updated `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the change and tests added.

# Quickstart â€” Magma to C (example)

This quickstart shows a tiny Magma program, the expected generated C, and how you would compile and run it once the compiler emits C source.

## Example Magma program

Save as `examples/hello.mg`:

    fn main() -> i32 {
        let x: i32 = 2 + 3;
        print(x);
        return 0;
    }

Notes:
- `print` prints an integer followed by a newline.

## Expected generated C

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        int x = 2 + 3;
        printf("%d\n", x);
        return 0;
    }

## Compile & run (once you have the generated C file)

On Windows with gcc (MinGW) or a Unix-like shell:

    gcc -std=c11 -O2 -o hello hello.c
    ./hello

On Windows with MSVC (Developer Command Prompt):

    cl /EHsc /O2 hello.c
    hello.exe

## Roadmap for tooling

1. Implement a `magmac` tool that takes `.mg` files and emits `.c` files.
2. Provide command-line flags for target C dialect, optimization, and output paths.
3. Add tests under `tests/` to compare generated C with expected output.

## Contributing examples

Add example Magma files to `examples/` and include the expected `.c` in `examples/generated/` to help validate code generation as the compiler is developed.

## Small-expression CLI usage

The repository includes a tiny CLI stub (`magma.CLI`) that can evaluate very small expressions passed as a single argument. For example, running the CLI with the argument `5+3` will cause the tool to parse and evaluate the expression and exit with code `8` (the sum), which is useful for quick end-to-end checks in tests.

Note: this is a lightweight development convenience and not a full REPL.

## Code style checks (Checkstyle)

The `magma-core` module includes a Maven Checkstyle plugin configuration that generates a style report. The plugin is configured to run during the `test` phase, so invoking the standard test lifecycle will execute Checkstyle as well. By default the plugin is configured not to fail the build so contributors can iterate without strict enforcement.

Run Checkstyle explicitly with:

    mvn checkstyle:checkstyle -f java/magma-core/pom.xml

Or simply run the full test lifecycle (recommended):

    mvn -q clean test -f java/magma-core/pom.xml

The Checkstyle report will be generated under `java/magma-core/target/site/checkstyle.html`.

To enforce style violations as build failures, edit the plugin configuration in `java/magma-core/pom.xml` and set `<failsOnError>true</failsOnError>`.

## Duplicate detection (PMD CPD)

The `magma-core` module runs PMD's CPD duplication check during the `test` phase. The current configuration uses a low token threshold (60 tokens) and includes test sources. If CPD finds duplicates above this threshold, the build will fail.

To run duplication checks explicitly:

    mvn pmd:cpd-check -f java/magma-core/pom.xml

The CPD report will be available under `java/magma-core/target/site/cpd.html` if duplicates are found.

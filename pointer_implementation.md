# Pointer Implementation in Magma

This document describes the implementation of pointer support in the Magma language.

## Overview

The implementation adds support for pointers in Magma, similar to Rust's pointer system. Key features include:

1. **Pointer Types**: Both mutable and immutable pointers are supported
2. **Pointer Creation**: Syntax for creating pointers from variables
3. **Dereferencing**: Ability to access and modify values through pointers
4. **Type Safety**: Strong type checking for pointer operations

## Implementation Details

### TypeInfo Class

The `TypeInfo` class was extended to support pointer types:

- Added `isPointer` field to track whether a type is a pointer
- Added `isPointerMutable` field to track whether a pointer is mutable
- Updated constructors to support these new fields

### Type Annotations

The `findExplicitTypeAnnotation` method was modified to recognize pointer type annotations:

- Added support for mutable pointer syntax: `*mut TypeName`
- Added support for immutable pointer syntax: `*TypeName`
- Returns appropriate TypeInfo with pointer-specific fields set

### Pointer Creation

A new `processPointerCreation` method was added to handle pointer creation expressions:

- Supports syntax: `*mut x` for mutable pointers and `*x` for immutable pointers
- Extracts the variable name from the expression
- Verifies that the variable exists and has the correct type
- Ensures that mutable pointers can only be created from mutable variables
- Translates to C's address-of operator: `&x`

### Dereferencing

A new `processPointerDereference` method was added to handle pointer dereferencing:

- Supports syntax: `*y = value` for assigning through a pointer
- Extracts the pointer name from the expression
- Verifies that the pointer exists, is a pointer, and is mutable (for assignment)
- Performs type checking on the assigned value
- Translates to C's dereference syntax: `*y = value`

### Block Processing

Fixed an issue with semicolons in block contexts:

- Modified `processSemicolonToken` to add a semicolon to statements before processing

## Usage Examples

### Creating Pointers

```
let mut x : I32 = 100;
let y : *mut I32 = *mut x;  // Mutable pointer to x
let z : *I32 = *x;          // Immutable pointer to x
```

### Dereferencing Pointers

```
let mut x : I32 = 100;
let y : *mut I32 = *mut x;
*y = 200;  // Modifies x through the pointer
```

### Type Safety

- Cannot create a mutable pointer to an immutable variable
- Cannot assign through an immutable pointer
- Cannot create a pointer of one type to a variable of another type

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were added to verify the pointer implementation:

- Basic pointer creation
- Pointer dereferencing
- Immutable pointers
- Type checking
- Error cases

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the pointer implementation works as expected.

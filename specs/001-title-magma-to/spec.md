# Feature Specification: Magma ‚Üí C compiler

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-magma-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A compiler from my custom programming language, Magma, to C."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Magma language user, I want to compile my Magma source files into readable, idiomatic C code so that I can build and link the output with standard C toolchains and run the resulting programs on systems that support C.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Magma source file, **When** the user runs the compiler, **Then** the compiler emits one or more C source files and a return code 0 indicating success.
2. **Given** an invalid Magma source file (syntax or semantic errors), **When** the user runs the compiler, **Then** the compiler prints human-readable error messages with file/line references and returns a non-zero exit code; no C output files are produced.
3. **Given** Magma source that depends on external libraries or platform-specific features, **When** the compiler cannot map constructs to C, **Then** it reports clear [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected handling of foreign/library bindings] notes.

### Edge Cases
- Large source files: ensure memory usage and compile time are reasonable (performance targets unspecified). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target performance/scale]
- Ambiguous language features or underspecified semantics in Magma: compiler must surface clear diagnostics with a description of the ambiguity. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how strict should the compiler be when semantics are underspecified?]
- Platform-specific behavior (endianness, word size) must be defined for generated C or documented as assumptions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported target platforms/ABIs]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The compiler MUST accept one or more Magma source files as input and produce equivalent C source file(s) and/or headers as output.
- **FR-002**: The compiler MUST report syntax and semantic errors with clear messages including file and line numbers.
- **FR-003**: The compiler MUST preserve Magma program semantics (as specified by the Magma language reference). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: provide or link to Magma language reference if available]
- **FR-004**: The generated C MUST be buildable with a standard C compiler (e.g., gcc/clang) on supported targets, producing equivalent runtime behavior for supported programs.
- **FR-005**: The compiler MUST provide a command-line interface with standard flags: input files, output directory, verbosity/log level, and a --help option. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: desired CLI flag names and additional flags (optimization levels, debug info)]
- **FR-006**: For undefined or unmappable language features, the compiler MUST emit informative diagnostics and either provide a compile-time error or a configurable fallback. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default policy for unmappable constructs]
- **FR-007**: The compiler SHOULD support generating one C file per Magma module, or an option to emit a single combined C translation unit.
- **FR-008**: The compiler SHOULD optionally emit debug information or mapping data (e.g., comments or a source map) to make debugging the generated C easier.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Magma AST**: Internal representation of parsed Magma code used for semantic analysis and code generation.
- **Symbol Table**: Records declarations, scopes, and types for semantic checks and name resolution.
- **Codegen Unit**: Represents a translation unit that will be emitted as a C source or header file.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [ ] No implementation details that prescribe internal code structure (the spec may reference C as the target language because that's the user value)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for technical and non-technical stakeholders who need to understand capability and acceptance
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved (or explicitly accepted as outstanding risks)
- [ ] Requirements are testable: unit testable compiler behavior and end-to-end compilation tests
- [ ] Success criteria: example Magma programs compile and run producing expected outputs; error cases produce deterministic diagnostics
- [ ] Scope: translate Magma to portable C for supported subset; does not include implementing a Magma runtime unless required
- [ ] Dependencies/Assumptions: availability of Magma language reference; supported C toolchains (gcc/clang); target platforms/ABIs to be defined

 * A node that represents a Java constructor in the code generation system.

 * 
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * JavaMethodHeader constructor = new JavaConstructor();
 * String code = constructor.generate();  // "?"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note: This implementation might be incomplete or intended to be extended in future versions.
